<p>
  Hello, my name is Mily. I used to work as an Export Customer Service Officer
  and now want to change careers to become a Web Developer.
</p>

<p>
  I graduated from Kasetsart University with a Bachelor of Arts in English
  major. My minor field was English for Service Industry.
</p>

<p>
  I was an Export Customer Service Officer which experienced customer service
  representative in terms of freight forwarder including knowledge of booking
  vessels,<br />
  issuing export documentation, and coordinating with customers and shipping
  lines. I also had specific experience with leather chemical products
  containing dangerous goods.<br />
  I'm a positive person and certainly focus on the importance of skill
  development. With a particular interest in the Full-Stack Developer or QA
  Tester.
